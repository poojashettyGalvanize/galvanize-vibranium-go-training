//Coverage commands needs to keep in mind
go test -cover
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out 	//The -coverprofile flag automatically sets -cover to enable coverage analysis
go tool cover -func=coverage.out  //we can ask for the coverage to be broken down by function, although that's not going to illuminate much in this case since there's only one function
go tool cover -html=coverage.out // html
